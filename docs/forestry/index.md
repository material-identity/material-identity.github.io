# Introduction

## Digital Material Passport (DMP) for Forestry

### Purpose of DMP for Forestry

The Digital Material Passport (DMP) for forestry and wood products provides a standardized way to document and exchange information about harvested wood throughout its supply chain. It enables compliance with regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), the U.S. Lacey Act, and other international frameworks that require proof of legal harvesting and traceability of forest products.

DMPs serve multiple purposes:
- Documenting the legal harvesting of timber products
- Providing chain of custody information
- Supporting due diligence requirements
- Enabling verification of sustainability claims
- Facilitating international trade of wood products

### Current Situation

Currently, forestry supply chains rely heavily on paper documentation and PDF files to exchange critical information about wood products. This includes harvest permits, chain of custody certificates, phytosanitary certificates, and shipping documents. This approach presents several challenges:

- Information is scattered across multiple documents
- Data cannot be easily extracted or processed by computers
- Verification of claims is time-consuming and error-prone
- Meeting compliance requirements requires significant manual effort
- Supply chain transparency is limited

### Design Goals

Based on industry needs and regulatory requirements, the Digital Material Passport for Forestry schemas have been developed with the following design goals:

- Well-defined and documented JSON format
- Easy to read for software developers, compliance officers, and supply chain professionals
- Extensible to accommodate future regulatory requirements
- Published as open-source to encourage industry adoption
- Supported by open-source tools to facilitate implementation
- Backward compatibility through PDF visualization
- Creating a foundation for a more transparent forestry supply chain ecosystem

## DMP Schema Structure

The DMP for Forestry ecosystem consists of two complementary schemas:

1. **ForestrySource Schema**: Documents the origin of the timber at the point of harvest, including geographical coordinates, harvest permits, and species information.

2. **Forestry Schema**: Tracks forest products throughout the supply chain, linking back to source information and providing documentation for each transaction.

Together, these schemas create a complete chain of custody from forest to final product.

# Features

## Standardization of Data Format

### Current Situation

Currently, forestry supply chains rely on a variety of documents in different formats to exchange information:

- Harvest permits in PDF format
- Chain of custody certificates as scanned documents
- Shipping documents in various formats
- Phytosanitary certificates as physical documents

This fragmentation makes it difficult to:
- Verify the legality and sustainability of forest products
- Meet regulatory requirements efficiently
- Automate compliance processes
- Provide transparency throughout the supply chain

### Objectives

The Digital Material Passport for Forestry aims to:

- Standardize the format for exchanging forestry data
- Create a single source of truth for supply chain documentation
- Enable automated verification of claims
- Reduce manual effort in compliance processes
- Support regulatory requirements such as EUDR, Lacey Act, etc.

### Solution

The DMP for Forestry provides a standardized JSON format that:

- Captures all relevant information in a structured way
- Links to supporting documentation
- Can be rendered as HTML or PDF for human readability
- Can be processed by computers for automated verification
- Creates an auditable chain of custody from forest to final product

## Rendering in Multiple Languages

The DMP for Forestry supports rendering in multiple languages, making it accessible to international supply chain partners.

### Current Situation

Forest products are traded globally, requiring documentation that can be understood by people who speak different languages.

### Objectives

- Standardize translations for terms used in the forestry industry
- Support multiple languages in a single document
- Enable the easy addition of new languages

### Implementation

The schema supports specifying one or two languages for rendering:

```json
"Languages": ["EN", "DE"]
```

The system will automatically translate field labels based on the translations provided in the corresponding language files.

## Supporting Documentation

The DMP for Forestry includes references to supporting documentation, providing evidence for claims made in the passport.

### Current Situation

Currently, supporting documents are often shared separately from the information they validate, making verification difficult and time-consuming.

### Solution

The DMP for Forestry allows attaching documents by reference, including:
- Harvest authorizations
- Forest concession documents
- Certification documents
- Phytosanitary certificates
- Maps and geographical data

Each document is referenced with:
- A cryptographic hash to verify authenticity
- A MIME type for proper handling
- A URL for accessing the document

## Chain of Custody

The DMP for Forestry creates a verifiable chain of custody through references to other DMPs.

### Current Situation

Tracking forest products from harvest to final use often involves multiple transactions and transformations, making it difficult to verify the original source.

### Solution

The DMP References feature allows linking documents in the supply chain:
- Source DMPs document the initial harvest
- Forestry DMPs reference source DMPs
- Each transaction in the supply chain can reference previous DMPs

This creates a verifiable chain of custody from forest to final product.

## Geographical Data

The ForestrySource schema includes geographical data about harvest locations using the GeoJSON format.

### Current Situation

Current documentation often includes vague or imprecise information about harvest locations, making it difficult to verify claims about the origin of forest products.

### Solution

The ForestrySource schema uses GeoJSON to precisely document harvest locations:
- Points or polygons can be used to define harvest units
- Multiple harvest units can be included in a single DMP
- Additional properties can provide context for each location
- Maps can be attached as supporting documentation

# Tools

Tools supporting the validation, testing, and rendering of Forestry and ForestrySource schemas as PDF are available as part of the Material Identity ecosystem. These tools, along with the schema definitions, examples, and documentation, are consolidated in the central repository at [https://github.com/material-identity/schemas](https://github.com/material-identity/schemas).
